As a break from my geesePatrol website, I decided to work with the canvas element in JavaScript to create a score oriented breakout game for people to play.

The website was designed with HTML and CSS combined, to make the game look like as if it was on a windows XP computer. This was just an additional feature that I decided to have fun with.
